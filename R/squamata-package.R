##' @details
##' This R package provides access to a number of different types of phylogenies, as well as a compilation 
##' of species-level ecological, morphological and other attributes. 
##' 
##' \strong{Note that an internet connection is required for use of this package}, as data are downloaded rather than 
##' bundled with the package. When functions from this R package are used, a temporary directory is created, into which
##' data objects are downloaded. Objects are downloaded only once per R session, so repeated runs of the same function
##' will not lead to repeated identical downloads. However, the temporary folder is deleted at the end of the R session.
